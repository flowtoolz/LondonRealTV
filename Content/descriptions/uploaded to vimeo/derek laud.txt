Derek is an exceptionally articulate, thoughtful and penetrating mind, and he delivers his ideas with a classic, clipped and brilliantly posh English accent.

At once old school and with a finger on the pulse, Derek sees the big picture on events of the day. Though his background is in the trenches of party politics, Derek is really a man of ideas. We talked about everything from celebrity culture, to freedom of the press and the Syrian refugee crisis.

I wanted to get Derek’s take on the ongoing refugee issue, not least because his latest book is called The Problem With Immigrants. Derek’s views on the topic are subtle, and he believes we need to move beyond the hysteria and knee-jerk reactions displayed in the media. Frankly, it was refreshing to listen to someone so informed on the issue of immigration, and to hear Derek’s cool-headed reaction to the whole thing.

He’s a conservative, but Derek is no longer a part of the mainstream of Tory politics in the UK. He goes into the reasons for that in this episode, and reveals a very original and independent perspective on current affairs.

He was a contestant on Big Brother and like so many facts about Derek, this seems an unlikely choice of path for someone so refined.

On the one hand he’s this gentleman of the old order – well spoken, charming, intimidatingly intelligent and witty. On the other hand though, he is completely unafraid to speak his mind and demands the same straight-shooting attitude of others.

Derek has never been anything other than completely himself, and it’s what made him popular on Big Brother, and it’s probably what makes him a confidante of the great and the good in politics. It’s also this quality that made him such joy to interview, and which makes him an ideal London Real guest.

So brew a pot of English tea and get comfortable, for what I promise will be both an educational and entertaining episode.

Ladies and gentleman, I give you Derek Laud!
