It is truly a pleasure to present to you once again six-times Mr Olympia Dorian Yates.

In this week’s interview Dorian takes us back to his days as a troubled but determined young man, struggling to find his way after losing his father at 14.

Bodybuilding for Dorian was, and is, more than just a sport. The attention to detail, the discipline, the emphasis on form and muscle control mean that he also considers it an art form.

For all you athletes out there, you will have more than enough new knowledge to discover in this episode about training, nutrition and the human body.

Dorian has PhD knowledge in all these things. But he’s also an expert in psychology. Dorian’s extra-competitive nature drove him to mastery over his mind. To this day the thing that marks out his career is the mental attitude he brought to the sport.

Bodybuilding is such a disciplined and psychologically demanding craft, that Dorian had inadvertently prepared himself for life’s spiritual challenges. He is a very spiritual guy, and at times talks like an old sage.

He wants to make the world a better place. But his message is very simple — change your mind and you change your reality.

He applies the same level-headedness, humility and quiet confidence to every topic we cover in this episode. It’s Dorian’s consistency that makes him such an impressive guest, and probably what makes him such an appealing character to his fans.

He is ruthlessly himself, regardless of the situation, and it is this authenticity that makes him such a pleasure to interview.
