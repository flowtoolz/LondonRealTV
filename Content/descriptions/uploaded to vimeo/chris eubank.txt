This Sunday morning, Brian steps into the ring with the one and only Christopher Livingstone Eubanks. In what is to be one of the best episodes in London Real history, we get an uncompromising portrait of the great icon and legend of British boxing.

There are no half-measures in boxing. In a sport that pushes the human body to it’s absolute peak, it’s all or nothing every day. Eubank is a man that has experienced high performance on a scale few of us could dream, on Sunday we hear the story from both inside the ring and outside it. Eubank is a gentleman, as sharp and as vivid a storyteller as there is, sharing with signature poetic eloquence a biography forged in blood, sweat and perseverance.

From poverty and trouble in school, to the top of his game his story is one of greatness. In his first 10 years as a professional boxer Eubank went undefeated. He held world titles at both Middleweight and Super Middleweight, was world champion for over 5 years. Pushing himself to the limit he has inspired thousands to put on the gloves and to step in the ring. The life lessons of a boxer, however, are just as real and relevant in any context.

Whoever you are, whatever you do this is one interview that will change you. Tune in.
