This week’s episode on London Real sees the return of strength and conditioning coach Steve Maxwell.

If this is your first experience of Steve, I urge you to put away your preconceptions – this guy will change how you think about health, fitness and happiness. We covered so much ground during this interview, including everything from breath control, marijuana, meditation and fitness, to how to control your thoughts.

Steve is his own man. He doesn’t play by society’s rules. He just travels the world spreading his message of mind and body conditioning, and manifesting resources if and when he needs them.

You wouldn’t expect an ex-army man, wrestler and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expert to talk about ‘spreading good vibes’ or manifesting health through affirmations. But that’s Steve. He is not just open minded, he is absolutely a free thinker.

Steve is convinced that all ill-health, disease and fitness problems have their roots in the mind, and much of his time is spent doing ‘inner work’ with his clients. Workouts for Steve are not about performance goals and they should NEVER be a source of anxiety.

Steve is part drill-sergeant, part yogi and part wandering sage. He embodies so much of what we value here at London Real, particularly the necessity of thinking for yourself.

Watch one of London Real’s favourite bad asses drop knowledge on everything from kettle bells to psychedelics.
