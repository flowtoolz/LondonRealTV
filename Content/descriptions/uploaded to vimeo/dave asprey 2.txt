This week’s episode of London Real features the return of Dave Asprey, the Bulletproof Exec himself, and long time favourite of the show.

Dave talks about a range of topics, from coffee (of course!) and mould toxins, to meditation. But there’s a common theme running through this whole episode: making the world a better place.

Dave believes it is our birthright to know the truth about what we put in our bodies, and what will optimise our performance. Like Dave says in the episode, we don’t plug our computers into damaging power sources, and we shouldn’t do that with our bodies either!

Dave has been around for a long time, honing his skills in Silicon Valley working for super successful companies. He reveals that the shift into Bulletproof wasn’t as logical as you might assume.

As you probably know, Dave is a controversial figure. His ideas and his openness to try anything that works, whether its a manufactured drug, or an organic plant, has brought him a lot of criticism. Biohacking is not just about good dieting, it’s about optimising performance in all areas of life.

Though he comes from a background in tech and business, Dave is also an incredibly intuitive and emotional guy. In fact, emotions, and being connected to your feelings, seem to be a big part of what biohacking means to Dave. For this reason, Dave believes biohacking is as much an art, as it is a science.

Dave Asprey is a man whose chief values include community, family and helping other people. He’s very clear about his mission, and it’s nothing less than changing the world! Dave is going to change the way you think about your body, your environment and your mission as a human being.
