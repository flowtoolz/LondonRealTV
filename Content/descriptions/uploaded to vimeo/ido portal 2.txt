This week on London Real, the movement expert Ido Portal, one of our most important guests.

Last time we talked a lot of Ido the man, his background in Capoeira and his upbringing in Israel. This time we go deeper into the philosophy of Ido’s work.

As you will see, the more I try to pin Ido down on a clear description of what it is he actually does, the more philosophical he becomes. I believe that’s proof of Ido’s highly evolved approach to teaching movement.

Ido is far more clear about what his movement teaching is NOT, rather than what it is. It is NOT another fad. It is NOT about fancy techniques and showing off like a break dancer. It’s NOT a functional philosophy, like a martial art or a style of dance. Ido’s philosophy, and Ido the man for that matter, are illusive.

Keeping the ideas behind his teaching so expansive means that his impact on his students is profound, and deeply personal. It’s about YOUR relationship with YOUR body.

Ido is about ditching the specialist approach to fitness and the body. In fact, the word fitness is something he wants to get away from.

For Ido, ‘there is no black belt’. His approach to movement is about trying to stay a white belt, to always be in that moment of discovery. So the point is not the technique you are practising in that moment. It’s not about athletics, and showing off. Ido is only happy when his students are practicing their movement from a state of freshness and personal development.

This creates both accelerated growth in your physical abilities, but at the same time it creates the humility necessary to truly integrate that growth.

There’s no other guest who better embodies so many of our values here at London Real.
