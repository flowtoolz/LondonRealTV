This week’s episode of London Real brings you the investment banker and pitch master Oren Klaff.

As I’m sure you know this is Oren’s second visit to the show, and his first time back since we created our brand new studio and launched London Real Academy.

Oren is a man brimming with energy, stories, humour, and insights on life, as well as being an absolute killer when it comes to the business pitch.

Oren plays in the big league every day, dealing with tough people in tough industries and playing for big money.

This is one of those episodes that is, beginning to end, packed with tips, knowledge and practical advice on getting things done, and winning people over to your ideas.

Oren’s idea of a pitch is different from what maybe pops into your head at first. He’s not interested in slides and slides of presentations, facts and figures and streams of data. For Oren, a pitch is a primal experience, an extreme sport, a kind of psychedelic experience in itself.

I get him to break down each moment of a typical pitch, each phase of the operation, from walking into the room, to closing.

This episode is going to fly by, and you’re probably going to need to watch it twice. Oren talks about so much, gets really deep into the mechanics of the pitch. But he’ll make you laugh and touch your heart and you won’t even know how he does it.

And if you are one those types that thinks business and ‘pitching’ is ‘not for you’, then Oren has a lot to say about that too. We’re always pitching, because we all need to win support to get things done.

So I hope you are sitting comfortably, because this interview is a RIDE believe me.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Oren Klaff.
