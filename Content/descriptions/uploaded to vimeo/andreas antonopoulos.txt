If talk about currencies, network systems and internet security is something that scares you, then you are about to have your mind blown. This week’s episode of London Real brings you Andreas Antonopoulos – technologist, serial entrepreneur and world Bitcoin expert.

Andreas addresses the bad press Bitcoin has received and is adamant that it’s about to change. As he points out, this is part of the journey of any new cutting edge technology. 

The big paradox at the heart of Bitcoin is that it simulates a coin made from precious metal, i.e. it’s rare. It doesn’t immediately make sense to have a digital ‘thing’ be rare, as everything in the digital world can be copied ad infinitum. Confused? Well, you’ve come to the right place!

Andreas’s genius is in making complex economic and digital concepts understandable. During the episode, Andreas lead us from his first discoveries of Bitcoin to his now widely accepted expertise, and his evangelism for the currency.

Andreas insists, however, he is not selling Bitcoin. He simply wants to open up the dialogue about the future of money, and reveal to ordinary people the scope of the technology.

For a guy who spends his life talking about computer systems and economics, he’s remarkably easy to communicate with. He’s candid, passionate about what he does, and his optimism about Bitcoin is infectious.

Tune in to watch a fascinating person unravel the cutting edge of money in the digital age.
