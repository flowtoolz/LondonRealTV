Who do you want approval from right now? Are you driven towards your goals because they are valuable in themselves, or because you want to make a point to someone? Are you living authentically, or at the mercy of a story that no longer works for you?

This week’s guest on London Real is Philip McKernan. Philip believes that the biggest barrier to creating a meaningful life is the quality of relationship you have with yourself.

For Philip, we live in a culture dominated by the mind. It’s his mission to turn people away from their minds, and towards their true selves. After working with thousands of people from the rich and the powerful, to orphans in the poor world, Philip is convinced that our struggles and depressions can be healed if we would just stop and listen to our intuition.

As he tells me in the course of our amazing discussion, when we give up trying to be who we think we should be, and allow ourselves to be who we really are, then we can start to build lasting happiness and self-worth.

Philip’s message is powerful, and he doesn’t waste words. This week’s interview is packed with ideas and practical advice on making the leap from what Philip calls ‘mindset’ to ‘soulset’.

Just listening to Philip Mckernan is gonna make you feel like you are doing serious and fulfilling inner work.
