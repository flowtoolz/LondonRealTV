Two years ago Peter and I had a tremendous, enlightening and inspiring couple of hours in the studio together. He had such an impact on London Real, and has brought many new fans to our show.

During this episode you are going to find out a lot more about the man Peter Sage, as well as getting more of his wisdom.

We revisit the framework of consciousness Peter outlined for us in the first episode, on how we can go from ‘To Me’ to ‘By Me’ into ‘Through Me’ and eventually hit ‘As Me.’

One thing that really strikes you about Peter is the efficiency of his way of looking at the world. He’s got so so much wisdom, but his main concern is making it understandable, and ultimately practical.

So yes, we talk more about GOOP and how to not care about what others think. We talk about the four levels of consciousness that help us reframe our perceptions of life. And we talk about how dangerous victimhood thinking is.

It was great to find out what Peter, another former mentee of Dan’s, really thinks of the force of nature that is The Fifty Billion Dollar Man.

Peter has this way with words, and it’s uncanny. He can summarise heavy spiritual truths in short, sharp phrases that just kick your mind awake.

If I can give you one piece of advice, though, it’s have a pen and paper to hand. Peter makes every moment in this interview count, and delivers value with each answer. Be prepared!
