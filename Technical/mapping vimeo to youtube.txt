* general: I identify the youtube and the vimeo video for the same episode by the titles provided on vimeo and youtube

* title starts with guest name followed by " - "

* The guest name is written exactly the same on youtube and vimeo... for example, i had to match "dr. " with "dr " and "VENOM" with "Venom" 

* if I strip the title of the following phrases, i get the exact same string "guest names - episode title" on youtube and vimeo: white spaces, characters like | and -,  "| London Real", "REDUX", "PART 1/2"
